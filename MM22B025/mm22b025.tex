\subsection{Definition}
When the X-ray is incident onto a crystal surface, its angle of incidence, $\theta$, will reflect with the same angle of scattering, $\theta$. And, when the path difference, d is equal to a whole number, n, of wavelength, $\lambda$, constructive interference will occur. The relation between the wavelength $\lambda$, order, path difference and $\theta$ is called the Bragg's equation.
\\
\subsection{Formula}
\begin{equation}
\centering
n\lambda = 2dsin\theta \footnote{Reference: https://byjus.com/physics/braggs-law/}
\end{equation}
where, \\
$\lambda$ = Wavelength of incident ray\\
$\theta$ = Angle of incidence of ray\\
d = path difference
n = order of x-rays
