\section{Governing Equation of a Damped Driven Oscillator}
Consider a damped forced oscillator with mass $m$, damping coefficient $b$, angular frequency $\omega$, and external force \(F_ocos(\omega t)\).The equation of motion can be given by:\\\\
\textsc{\Large  \(m\ddot{x} + b\dot{x} + kx = F_ocos(\omega t)\)}\\\\

where $x$ represents the displacement of the oscillator as a function of time $t$, and $\ddot{x}$ and $\dot{x}$ denote the second derivative and first derivative of $x(t)$ with respect to time, respectively.
