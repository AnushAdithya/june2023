So here I am going to describe the continuity equation
\subsection{CONTINUITY EQUATION}
A continuity equation or transport equation is an equation that describes the transport of some quantity. It is particularly simple and powerful when applied to a conserved quantity
\subsection{integral form}
The integral form of the continuity equation states that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The amount of q in a region increases when additional q flows inward through the surface of the region, and decreases when it flows outward.
  \item The amount of q in a region increases when new q is created inside the region, and decreases when q is destroyed.
  \item Apart from these two processes, there is no other way for the amount of q in a region to change.
Mathematically,
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dq}{dt} + \iint_S jdS = \Sigma
\end{equation}
\footnote{URL: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_equation}}
where,
\begin{itemize}
    \item S is any imaginary closed surface, that encloses a volume 
    \item q is the total amount of the quantity in the volume V
    \item j is the flux of q
    \item t is time
    \item $\Sigma$  is the net rate that q is being generated inside the volume V per unit time. When q is being generated, it is called a source of q, and it makes $\Sigma$ more positive. When q is being destroyed, it is called a sink of q, and it makes $\Sigma$ more negative
\end{itemize}

\subsection{differential form}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla j = \sigma
\end{equation}
\cite{seis2017quantitative}
where,
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\rho$ is the amount of the quantity q per unit volume
    \item t is time
    \item j is the flux of q
    \item $\sigma$ is the generation of q per unit volume per unit time
\end{itemize}
This general equation may be used to derive any continuity equation, ranging from as simple as the volume continuity equation to as complicated as the Navierâ€“Stokes equations. This equation also generalizes the advection equation.

In the case that q is a conserved quantity that cannot be created or destroyed (such as energy), $\sigma$ = 0 and the equations become:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla j = 0
\end{equation}

\subsection{REASON FOR TAKING UP THE EQUATION:} 
Understanding and applying the continuity equation opens up a wide range of opportunities for analysis, design, research, and innovation in fields related to fluid dynamics. It forms the basis for solving real-world problems and advancing knowledge in various scientific and engineering disciplines.
