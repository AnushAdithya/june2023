\textbf{\Large Joules Heating Law Equation Is $Q=I^2RT$}
\newline

In This Equation,

\begin{itemize}

    \item Q indicates the amount of heat
    \item I show electric current
    \item R is the amount of electric resistance in the conductor
    \item T denotes time
\\
\\
    Jouleâ€™s law is a mathematical description of the rate at which resistance in a circuit converts electric energy into heat energy.

The English physicist James Prescott discovered that the amount of heat per second that develops in a current-carrying conductor is proportional to the electrical resistance of the wire and the square of the current.

The heat that is generated because of the current flow in an electric wire is described in Joules
