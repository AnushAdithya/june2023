My Equation: $F = ma$ \footnote{This equation represents Newton's second law of motion.}

This equation, known as Newton's second law of motion, describes the relationship between force (F), mass (m), and acceleration (a). It states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration.
