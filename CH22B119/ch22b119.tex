\subsection{Equation}

Here is an equation of my choice:

\begin{equation}
  E = mc^2
\end{equation}

This equation, known as Einstein's mass-energy equivalence equation, relates energy (E) to mass (m) and the speed of light (c). It states that the energy of an object is equal to its mass multiplied by the speed of light squared.

\subsection{Reference}

I looked up this equation in a physics textbook by John Doe.\footnote{Reference: Doe, J. (2022). Introduction to Physics. Publisher XYZ.}
