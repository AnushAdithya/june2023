  \textbf{y} represents the vertical position of the projectile at a
  given time. It tells us how high or low the projectile is above the
  ground (measured in meters).

  \textbf{u} is the initial velocity of the projectile. It represents
  the magnitude of the velocity vector at the instant of launch. The
  velocity has both horizontal and vertical components.

  determines the direction of the projectile's initial velocity vector.
  It is measured in degrees.
\item
  \textbf{t} is the time elapsed since the projectile was launched. It
  represents the independent variable of the equation and is measured in
  seconds.
\item
  \textbf{g} is the acceleration due to gravity. On Earth, it is
  approximately 9.8 (m/s\^{}2). It affects the vertical motion of the
  projectile, causing it to accelerate downward.
\end{itemize}

  \(\mathbf{t}_{\mathbf{\text{flight}}}\)represents the total time of
  flight of the projectile. It is the time it takes for the projectile
  to reach the ground after being launched. It is calculated as 2 × u ×

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \(\mathbf{u}\mathbf{\sin}\mathbf{\text{θt}}\)\textbf{:} This term
  represents the initial upward velocity component of the projectile. As
  the projectile is launched, this component contributes to the vertical
  displacement. It gradually decreases over time due to the effect of
  gravity.
\item
  \(\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{g}\mathbf{t}^{\mathbf{2}}\mathbf{:}\)This
  term represents the vertical displacement due to the downward
  acceleration caused by gravity. As time increases, the effect of
  gravity becomes more pronounced, causing the projectile to fall
  faster.

\textbf{Q2) Paragraph on how you went about choosing the equation.}
\\
\\
Firstly, I choosed this equation, because we are dealing with projectile
motion since class 11 and its interesting and easy to understand.
Projectile motion refers to the path followed by an object in motion
under the influence of gravity, where the only force acting on it is the
force of gravity. To accurately describe this motion, I chose the
equation that consists elements: initial velocity, launch angle, time of
flight, horizontal and vertical displacements, and acceleration due to
gravity. Moreover, working with projectile motion equations provided me
with a practical toolkit for solving real-world problems. Whether it was
analyzing the trajectory of a launched rocket, understanding the motion
of a baseball, or predicting the range of a cannonball, I felt empowered
to apply my knowledge and make meaningful calculations. It make us to
think pratically. In conclusion, I have chosen parametric equations for
projectile motion because they provide a comprehensive framework for
understanding and analyzing the behavior of objects moving under the
influence of gravity.
\\
\\
\textbf{Conclusion:-}
\\
\\
In conclusion, projectile motion is a fascinating phenomenon that occurs
when an object is launched into the air and moves under the influence of
gravity alone. It involves the object following a parabolic trajectory,
with its motion being divided into separate horizontal and vertical
components. By understanding and applying the principles of projectile
motion, we can analyze and predict the behavior of objects those launched at different angles and velocities
