\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Emf$ = emf induced on the coil
    \item $N$ = no of turns in the coil
    \item $\phi$ = flux in the coil
    \item $t$ = time period
\end{itemize}

\section*{EXPLANATION:}
\paragraph{Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction in 1831, and James Clerk Maxwell mathematically described it as Faradayâ€™s law of induction. Electromagnetic induction is the generation of a current as a result of voltage generation (electromotive force) caused by a changing magnetic field. This occurs when a conductor is placed in a moving magnetic field (when using an alternating current power source) or when a conductor is constantly moving in a stationary magnetic field. Michael Faraday set up a conducting wire as shown below, attached to a device that measured the voltage across the circuit. The voltage detector measures the voltage in the circuit when a bar magnet is moved through the coiling.~\cite{hcverma1992conceptsofphysics}}

\paragraph{Michael Faraday discovered this law of electromagnetic induction. He set up a lead wire according to the diagram above, which he connected to a device that measured the voltage across the circuit. When a bar magnet passes through the snaking, the voltage in the circuit is measured. The significance of this is that it is a method of producing electrical energy in a circuit by using magnetic fields rather than batteries. Machines such as generators, transformers, and motors operate on the principle of electromagnetic induction.~\cite{hcverma1992conceptsofphysics}}
